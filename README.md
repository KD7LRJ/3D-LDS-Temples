Currently (2022-03-18) all of these files were created and by Hugh Lyman and being organized here to facilitate their mantenance and sharing as the original reposity (Thingiverse) has been unstable.

These files have been placed here with Hugh's permission in hopes that this repository will provide better access, discussions, update tracking, etc.

The LDS Temples included are drawn from photographs and were drawn with AutoCad 11, solid modeling.

For now, please place comments, etc. in the Issues section here on Github.
