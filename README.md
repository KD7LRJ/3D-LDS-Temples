# 3D-temples
3D models of temples of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints

Currently (2022-06-16) all of these files were created by Hugh Lyman and being organized here to facilitate their mantenance and sharing as the original repository (Thingiverse) has been unstable.

These files have been placed here with Hugh's permission in hopes that this repository will provide better access, discussions, update tracking, etc.

The LDS Temples included are drawn from photographs and were drawn with AutoCad 11, solid modeling.
